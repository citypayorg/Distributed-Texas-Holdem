# Distributed-Texas-Holdem
The project presented is called "Distributed Texas Hold'em Poker", and consists in the design and implementation of a poker game, Texas Hold'em specialty, online (in LAN) and distributed, using the Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) technology.

With this project we want to provide an application that reflects as faithfully as possible the game of poker, that it is simple, robust to breakdowns and can be of help to those who have the problem and / or the need to organize a game having only one LAN (Ethernet or Wi-Fi) and computers.

This project was carried out for the examination of Distributed Systems at the University of Bologna (Magistral Computer Science).
